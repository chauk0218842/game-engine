##### 2016-12-01
- Initial commit: project scaffolding (setting up git; webpack; babel etc. etc.)
- This is my attempt to creating a game engine in JS
- My initial prototype is going to write this in jQuery
  - Create a sprite that can be navigated around the map via keyboard and mouse clicks (using some shortest-path algorithm)
  - I'd then evolve this to using some UI-framework (leaning towards React + Redux at the moment)
  - React's library is leaner than Angular, and I prefer it's component architecture
  - Redux will be useful to manage the game engine's state aka "animation state"
- Each day, I plan on doing at least 15 minutes of coding to get this project up and running eventually
- Hopefully, this will come to fruitation and be published publicly
